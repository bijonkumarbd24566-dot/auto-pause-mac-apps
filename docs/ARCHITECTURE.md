# Auto Pause Mac Apps — Architecture, module by module

Auto Pause Mac Apps is a single SwiftUI menu-bar executable built with Swift Package
Manager. No Xcode project, no external dependencies, no bundled frameworks. Every module
below is one file in `Sources/AutoPauseMacApps/`.

## `ProcessControl.swift` — the kernel-facing layer

Everything that talks to the OS about processes. No UI, no state; pure functions.

| Function | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `processTree(root:)` | Breadth-first walk via `proc_listchildpids`, returns the app plus every descendant | Chrome's memory lives in ~25 helper processes. Signalling only the parent would free almost nothing. |
| `memoryInfo(of:)` | One `proc_pid_rusage` call returning **both** `ri_resident_size` and `ri_phys_footprint` | The two numbers diverge enormously (Chrome: 275 MB vs 4.31 GB). Reporting only footprint made pausing look broken. |
| `treeMemory(root:)` | Sums `MemoryInfo` across the tree | An app's real cost is the whole tree. |
| `pauseTree(root:)` | `SIGSTOP` **parent first**, then descendants | Parent-first stops it spawning new children mid-freeze, which would escape the sweep. |
| `resumeTree(root:)` | `SIGCONT` children first, parent last | Reverse order so the parent finds its children already alive. |
| `isStopped(_:)` | Reads `pbi_status == SSTOP` | Ground truth. Detects apps frozen outside Pause, and survives Pause restarting. |
| `userProcesses()` | Enumerates every process owned by the current UID via `proc_listpids` | Finds the background services `NSWorkspace` never reports. Filtering to our own UID is also the safety boundary — without root we couldn't signal anything else anyway. |
| `protectedNames` / `isProtected` | Deny-list of ~30 processes | Freezing `WindowServer`, `ControlCenter` or `coreaudiod` wedges the UI or kills audio. These are never touchable. |

**Design note — why no entitlements.** Apple's guidance is to use `libproc` (`proc_pid_rusage`,
`proc_pidinfo`) rather than `task_for_pid()`, which is SIP-restricted to development tools.
Everything here works on same-user processes with no entitlement, no root, no TCC prompt.

## `DeepSleepController.swift` — the quit-and-restore tier

The only mechanism on macOS that frees **all** of an app's memory including swap.

- **`canRestoreState(bundleID:)`** — will this app bring its windows back?
  - Chromium browsers: reads `session.restore_on_startup` from the browser's own
    Preferences JSON (they ignore macOS Resume entirely).
  - Safari: reports that it uses its own "Safari opens with" setting.
  - Everything else: reads `NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows` from that app's preference domain.
  - Returns `.good` / `.fixable` / `.unknown`, which drives the warning sheet.
- **`enableStateRestoration(bundleID:)`** — writes `NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows` into that app's
  domain. Only ever called on explicit consent, and records what it changed so it can be reverted.
- **`sleep(app:…)`** — thaws the app if frozen (a `SIGSTOP`ped process can't process a quit
  Apple Event), then `terminate()` — a normal ⌘Q, **never** `forceTerminate`. Polls up to 10 s.
- **`watchForLateTermination`** — if the app was showing a save sheet and the user answers it
  minutes later, the app quits after we gave up. Without this watcher it would vanish from Pause
  with no way to wake it.
- **`wake(_:)`** — relaunches via `NSWorkspace.openApplication` with `activates = true`, and
  **only clears the record on success**. An earlier version cleared it unconditionally, so a
  failed relaunch erased the app from the UI permanently.

**Your work is never at risk.** Apps that autosave save and quit. Apps that don't show their
normal save sheet and stay open; Pause reports `.refused` and leaves them merely frozen.

## `AppListModel.swift` — state and policy

`@MainActor ObservableObject`, refreshed every 3 s while the panel is open.

- **Three states** per entry: `.running`, `.paused` (SIGSTOP), `.sleeping` (quit, resumable).
- **Two kinds**: `.app` (pause or deep sleep) and `.service` (freeze only — daemons have no
  state-restoration contract, and quitting them breaks sync/backups).
- **`serviceEntries(excluding:)`** — takes every user process not already inside a Dock app's
  tree, walks each up to its top-level ancestor under `launchd`, and groups by that ancestor.
  One row per *service* rather than a dozen anonymous child pids. Filters below 25 MB, caps at 40.
- **`reclaim(targetBytes:)`** — Local Model Mode. Freezes background apps and services
  heaviest-first until the target is met. Skips the frontmost app, protected processes and
  anything already suspended. Records the exact pid set as a `reclaimSession`.
- **`restoreReclaimSession()`** — undoes precisely what that run froze, leaving anything you
  froze by hand still frozen.
- **Sort order** — suspended entries pin to the top. They hold 0 resident RAM, so sorting purely
  by memory buried them beneath every running app and made them hard to bring back.
- **History** — rolling 40 samples of *resident* memory per entry, feeding the sparklines.

## `SystemStats.swift` — machine-wide numbers

One `host_statistics64` call plus `sysctl vm.swapusage`, decomposed into App / Wired /
Compressed / Free / Swap. Drives the ring gauge, the usage graph and the breakdown bar.

Worth understanding: **"Memory Used" includes compressed pages.** On a heavily oversubscribed
Mac (e.g. 43 GB logical on 16 GB physical) freeing a page just lets macOS page an active app
back in, so the gauge stays near max even as Pause genuinely reclaims gigabytes. That is macOS
behaving correctly — and it's exactly why per-app *resident* memory is the honest metric.

## Persistence — three small stores

All atomic JSON in `~/Library/Application Support/Pause/` (path kept stable across the rename — see the naming note below).

| File | Module | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `paused.json` | `PausedStore.swift` | Frozen apps. Guards against pid reuse by matching launch dates. If Pause is killed, frozen apps are still recognised on next launch. |
| `slept.json` | `SleptStore.swift` | Deep-slept apps. **Essential** — a slept app is gone from `runningApplications`, so without this record it would disappear and be unrecoverable. |
| `settings.json` | `AppSettingsStore.swift` | Per-app idle auto-pause (on/off, minutes), keyed by bundle ID. |

---

## Views

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `MenuView.swift` | The panel: ring gauge, system usage graph, and the list in three sections — SUSPENDED, APPS, BACKGROUND SERVICES. Sizes itself to the screen height (a `ScrollView` has no intrinsic size, so it needs an explicit height or the window collapses). |
| `DetailViews.swift` | `SparklineView`, `UsageAreaChart` (plotted against total RAM so normal fluctuation looks normal, not like a mountain range), and the per-app detail popover with auto-pause settings. |
| `SystemDetailView.swift` | Ring gauge, usage history, App/Wired/Compressed/Free/Swap breakdown, top processes. |
| `ReclaimView.swift` | Local Model Mode: target slider, feasibility estimate, and Restore. |
| `DeepSleepWarningView.swift` | First-run warning: explains Deep Sleep actually quits the app, reports that app's restore status, offers to enable window restore. |
| `PauseApp.swift` | `MenuBarExtra` host plus the `NSApplicationDelegate`. Presents the first-run walkthrough in a real `NSWindow` (an `LSUIElement` app isn't activated by default, so it calls `NSApp.activate` explicitly), and resumes every frozen app on quit so nothing is ever stranded. |
| `OnboardingView.swift` | Four-page animated walkthrough: welcome, the two tiers, Free Up Memory, and where to find the app + start-at-login. Exists because a menu-bar-only app with no Dock icon is easy to lose immediately after installing. |
| `LaunchAtLogin.swift` | `SMAppService.mainApp` wrapper. Registration is idempotent (registering when already enabled throws), and the status is read back afterwards — `register()` can succeed while the item still needs approval, or not take effect when the app runs from a DMG or build folder. |

> **Naming note.** The product is *Auto Pause Mac Apps*; the SwiftPM target and binary are
> `AutoPauseMacApps`. The Application Support directory deliberately remains `Pause/` — renaming
> it would orphan existing records and strand apps that users currently have frozen.
